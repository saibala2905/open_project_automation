To support the App's goal of engaging people in healthy communication with a robust points-based scoring system, below is a comprehensive list detailing the required API endpoints, authentication flows, and server-side optimizations essential for achieving high performance and user satisfaction.

### List of API Endpoints

1. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - **POST /api/auth/register**
     - Request Body: `{ "username": String, "email": String, "password": String }`
     - Description: Register a new user.
   - **POST /api/auth/login**
     - Request Body: `{ "email": String, "password": String }`
     - Description: Authenticate user and return JWT.
   - **GET /api/auth/logout**
     - Description: Invalidate user session.
   - **GET /api/auth/social/login**
     - Description: Handle OAuth login for social media accounts.

2. **User Management Endpoints**
   - **GET /api/users/:id**
     - Description: Retrieve user profile and stats.
   - **PATCH /api/users/:id**
     - Request Body: `{ "username": String, "email": String, "points": Number }`
     - Description: Update user profile information.

3. **Points Tracking Endpoints**
   - **GET /api/points/:id**
     - Description: Retrieve user points history and achievements.
   - **POST /api/points/award**
     - Request Body: `{ "userId": ObjectId, "points": Number, "activity": String }`
     - Description: Award points for completed challenges or activities.

4. **Challenge Management Endpoints**
   - **POST /api/challenges**
     - Request Body: `{ "title": String, "description": String, "point_reward": Number }`
     - Description: Create a new challenge.
   - **GET /api/challenges**
     - Description: Retrieve all challenges, optionally filterable by `status`.
   - **POST /api/challenges/:id/join**
     - Description: Participate in an existing challenge.
   - **POST /api/challenges/:id/complete**
     - Description: Mark a challenge as complete and trigger points award.

5. **Activity Log Endpoints**
   - **GET /api/activities/:userId**
     - Description: Fetch user's activity log.
   - **POST /api/activities**
     - Request Body: `{ "userId": ObjectId, "activity_type": String }`
     - Description: Log user activity.

6. **Feedback Endpoints**
   - **POST /api/feedback**
     - Request Body: `{ "userId": ObjectId, "feedback_text": String }`
     - Description: Submit user feedback.
   - **GET /api/feedback**
     - Description: Retrieve and manage feedback submissions.

### Authentication Flows

- **Email/Password Flow:**
  1. User sends a POST request to `/api/auth/register` with credentials.
  2. The server responds with a JWT upon successful registration or login.
  3. The token must be included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

- **Social Media OAuth Flow:**
  1. User clicks "Login with [Social Media]" leading to the OAuth providerâ€™s login page.
  2. Upon successful login, the provider redirects to the app, passing an authorization code.
  3. The app exchanges this code for JWT access tokens and stores them securely for future requests.

### Server-Side Optimizations

1. **API Security**
   - Implement JWT for authentication, ensuring each protected endpoint checks for a valid token.
   - Rate-limiting strategies to protect endpoints from abuse.

2. **Caching Strategies**
   - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as user profiles and leaderboard information.
   - Cache results of expensive database queries to reduce response time.

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Deploy using a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple server instances.

4. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Implement MongoDB indexing strategies (as previously outlined) for improved query performance.
   - Use the aggregation framework for complex queries, particularly for leaderboard computations.

5. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Utilize message queues (like RabbitMQ) for handling high-volume operations asynchronously, e.g., awarding points based on user activity.

6. **WebSockets for Real-Time Updates**
   - Integrate WebSockets for real-time communication for features such as messaging and live leaderboard updates.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging of API errors and performance metrics for debugging and optimization purposes.

By carefully implementing these API endpoints, authentication flows, and server-side optimizations, the application will be well-equipped to foster healthy communication and effectively reward users through a points-based tracking system. This structured and secure approach not only enhances user experience but also ensures scalability and performance, driving continued engagement and success for the app.
