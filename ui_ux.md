   - **Challenge Creation:** UI that allows users to create personal communication challenges, setting clear instructions, time frames, and point rewards for completion.
   - **Messaging Interface:** Clean, distraction-free design that facilitates healthy communication, with features like tone indicators and prompts to guide conversations.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Wireframe for a feedback submission page where users can give input about the app’s functionality, report issues, or suggest improvements.

**2. Prototypes:**
   - **Interactive Prototype in Figma:**
     - Navigate through the onboarding process to demonstrate how new users are introduced to app features and points scoring.
     - Showcase interaction with the leaderboard, enabling users to see their ranking in real-time.
     - Demonstrate the challenge creation flow, including selecting which friends to involve and notifying them of the challenge.
   - **Usability Testing Sessions:**
     - Prepare prototypes to test with a diverse group of individuals, observing how they use the app to gather insights on interaction flows and pain points.
     - Use tools like Maze or UserTesting to collect qualitative and quantitative data on user engagement and behaviour.

**3. UX Research Insights:**
   - **User Personas:** Developed personas such as "Healthy Communicator" (young professionals seeking better social interactions) and "Family Connector" (parents looking to enhance family communication), each with specific needs and motivations.
   - **Usability Heuristics:** 
     - Visibility of system status—providing clear feedback on point accumulation and activity completion.
     - User control and freedom—easy navigation that allows users to backtrack or re-engage without losing progress.
   - **Accessibility Compliance:** Implementing WCAG guidelines, ensuring contrast ratios meet standards and alternative text for images is used for visually impaired users.
   - **Engagement Strategies:** Gathering analytics to determine what prompts lead to increased app usage and finding opportunities for introducing gamification elements to sustain user interest.

By combining wireframes with prototypes and actionable UX research insights, the output will not only enhance the app’s usability but also foster an environment that promotes healthy communication through effective user engagement and innovative point-based tracking systems.
